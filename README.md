# Biological Applications of KGE Models

Example biological applications of knowledge graph embedding models




### Installation
First, you need to install the LibKGE library in it as follow:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samehkamaleldin/libkge.git
cd libkge
pip install -r requirements.txt
# change tensorflow version it to the gup version if you want to use GPUs for accelerated computation
pip install tensorflow==1.14 
python setup.py install
```

You are then ready to use the example script in this repository.
